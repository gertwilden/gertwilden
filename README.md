- 👋 Hi, I’m @gertwilden, a munich/germany based film composer and jazz musician
- 👀 I’m interested in getting started with scripting in TouchOSC. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program my own controll surfaces for ableton, and I get along pretty well as long its only about MIDI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 2 or three concrete - as I hope - simple applications that I have in mind. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I am looking forward to a mail under: gert.wilden@t-online.de

<! I am also also looking for somebody out there how would possibly be ready to do 1 or 2 custom scripts for me.
